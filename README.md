# Crop-and-Fertilizer-Recommendation
Procedure:-

•  Explored &  used Pandas, Numpy, Interact, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries to perform Univariate and Bivariate exploratory data analysis

•  Imputed missing values, dealt with imbalanced data using SMOTE & used pyspark standardscaler multiple columns for feature scaling

•  Achieved an accuracy of 96% by experimenting on Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Mean Clustering

Description In this project, an optimistic attempt has been made to support farmers; with the purpose to improve their farming productivity. 
Additionally, for doing so, a forecasting model has been developed by the use of machine learning; which can direct us, which crop will be
best suitable for a specific climatic condition.
